                    <h2> Pacman's Affect in History </h2>
                    <p class = "intros"> On the history of Pacman, what records we have give us an idea of how incredibly influential he was all aroud the world, but no clues whatsoever on his origins. This is due to him being <i> so </i> ancient, that modern science claims he is potentially older than the planet Earth itself. </p>

                    <h3> Bringing us Math </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\proof-of-perfection_resized.jpg" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> One example of his influence in not just history, but also science, is how he created mathematics. Through means unknown to mortals, he somehow imbued math into our universe, which actually makes sense since he is mathematically perfect as sighted by the visual proof above. </p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <a name = "life"></a>
                    <h3> The Creation of Life </h3>
                    <figure>    
                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\life-creation.png" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> In this astoundingly faithful depiction of Pacman, the artist decided to use DNA (which came from Pacman as well) to show how life was created by him. The artist also chose to add in the multi-colored pigeon to represent how, for Pacman, not even the sky is the limit. </p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <a name = "egypt"></a>
                    <h3> Interacting with Ancient Egypt </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\great-jewled-medallian.jpg" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> This beautiful jeweled medallion was actually created by the ancient Egyptians to depict the honor and strength that Pacman encapsulated when he had erected not only the Great Sphinx, but also all three of the Great Pyramids in an instant for them. However, for unknown reasons he immediately destroyed these creations and left as soon as he came. The Egyptians then decided to build these wonders once again in honor of the great being that had made them so efforlessly. </p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <a name = "philosophy"></a>
                    <h3> His Philosophical Teachings </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\quote_resized.jpg" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/>
                            <figcaption>
                                <p> Pacman has also affected the past in ways that influence how we think in the present. For instance, Pacman actually created philosophy as we know it. Above is an exerpt from him. Truly, a genius. </p>
                            </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <a name = "legend"></a>
                    <h3> Influence in Legends </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\chosen-one.png" alt = "Sorry, Tecnical Difficulties"/>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> In this, yet again, lifelike depiction of Pacman, he is seen taking out what appears to be the legendary sword from the great Aurthurian tale "Sword in the Stone". This shows how Pacman is the chosen hero to rule the land of Great Britan as king. However, Pacman decides to return the sword in the stone, because it was lunchtime, and he already had a knife. </p>

                    <h2> Pacman's True Power </h2>
                    <p class = "intros"> While studying Pacman's history, one could get a glimpse at his abilities, but those examples are the just the tip of the metaphorical iceberg when it comes to showcasing Pacman's true power. </p>

                    <h3> Google's Offering </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <a href = "https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man"> <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\google-offering.png" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/> </a>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> One great example to show how much power Pacman possesses, is how our internet overlord, Google themselves, has attempted to make their humble offering to him in the form of an interactive art piece. As you can see, this depiction of Pacman is based on his two-dimensional form. Click the image above to experience it fully! </p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <a name = "pellets"></a>
                    <h3> The Pellets of Power </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\pellets.gif" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> When Pacman eats big white pelets it makes his score go up, but when I do it I'm arrested for "Drug possesion". This shows that Pacman is seen to authorities as unstoppable, and are frightened to even attempt to confront him about it. </p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <a name = "ghosts"></a>
                    <h3> The Supernatural Realm </h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\ghost-consumption.png" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> Pacman has abilities so unknown to us mortals, that he even has power over the supernatural realm as well. Above is an example where Pacman is about to absorb and utterly <b> destroy </b>  this evil spirit. </p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <a name = "dimensions"></a>
                    <h3> No Dimensional Bounds </h3>

                        <img src = "C:\Users\Steam Test\Code\html_me_something\images\dimentional-transcendence.jpg" alt = "Sorry, Technical Difficulties"/>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p> This actual photo is showing an example of how Pacman is able to move between spatial dimentions with no effort at all, including those above the third-dimension as well. This allows him to appear as any shape, size, and form that he desires. This makes sense as artists and photographers always portray/show him in many different forms in their works. </p>

                        <figcaption>
                            <p> In this (yet again) actual footage of Pacman wishing us a Happy Halloween, we see that he is distorting reality to look like a moderatly compressed gif file, and has even decided to include a "gifs.com" watermark on existance itself, for unknown reasons. </p>

                    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                    <p class = "intros"> I hope that after reading this you can clearly see the true nature of Pacman, and to close this article up, I will quote a few words from a fellow child of Pacman, <a href = "https://youtu.be/9SHOp5D3-Nw?t=6m37s"> Jerma985 from YouTube: </a>
                    <figure>
                        <q> So pretty much the moral of the story and the purpose of this video is to simply say, uh, Pacman is <i> unstoppable. </i> He's <i> unbeatable. </i> And he's the best video game character <strong> ever. </strong> And if you want to argue that with me then all I got-- I got <i> four </i> words for ya. Pacman is the best character eva, you will never defeat him he is a <i> <strong> GOD </strong> </i> among men, and he is <i> undeniably </i> the greatest chracter ever in the history video ga-- that was like seventy words, but you get the idea. </q>
